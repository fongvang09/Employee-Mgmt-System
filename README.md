## Task

This assignment is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL. We'll need three tables for the database schema: employee, role and department. Command lines will prompt the user to add departments, roles and employees. It'll also allow users to view them as well and then finally to be able to update the roles of the employees.
